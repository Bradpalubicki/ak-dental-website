Hi Alex,

Hope things are going well at the practice. I wanted to reach out because I think we're at the point where it makes sense to move forward, and I want to make sure I give you everything you need to make that decision.

Since we last spoke, a lot has been accomplished. The AK Ultimate Dental website is fully built — every page, every service, the blog, reviews integration, the works. The backend platform (Dental Engine) is also built out with scheduling, clinical notes, charting, patient communications, and more. I've attached a full status document so you can see exactly where everything stands.

**The Opportunity**

Here's what I'm proposing, and I want to be straightforward about the structure so there's no ambiguity:

- The investment is **$20,000** into Dental Engine specifically — not NuStack as a whole
- Ken and I are each putting in $20,000 as well — so we're at $60K total to get this to market
- In return, you'd receive **equity ownership in Dental Engine** and share in its **profitability as it grows**
- This is the ground floor — we're at the test clinic stage now, and the upside is significant as we scale to other dental practices

**What You'd Actually Have to Do**

I know this was your question — and the honest answer is: not much.

1. **Be the face of it.** A couple short video testimonials, permission to use your name and credentials in our marketing ("Built with AK Ultimate Dental, Las Vegas"), and occasional availability for a reference call with a prospective client. That's maybe 2-4 hours a quarter total.

2. **Let us use AK Dental as the live platform.** Your practice runs on Dental Engine. Your staff uses the tools. When something needs improvement, you tell us. We fix it. You and your team never have to manage any of the technology — that's entirely on us.

That's it. No sales. No management. No operational headaches. You run your practice, and the platform runs in the background.

**What This Does For Your Practice — Right Now**

Beyond the investment, getting connected to the platform immediately benefits AK Dental in several concrete ways:

**Merchant Processing:** We're going to review your current processing statements and benchmark your rates. Most practices are paying more than they should — sometimes significantly. We will identify the savings and bring options to you. No obligation to switch, but you deserve to know what you're paying versus what's available.

**Electronic Billing:** Right now AK Dental is handling insurance claims without an electronic clearinghouse. This is one of the most impactful changes we can make. Electronic claim submission typically cuts your claim-to-payment cycle from 30-45 days down to 7-14 days, reduces denials, and frees up significant staff time. Based on a typical solo practice, this alone can mean $15,000–$40,000 in additional annual collections. The monthly service cost for the clearinghouse will be AK Dental's — we handle all the integration, enrollment with each payer, and ongoing management.

**Accounting & Bookkeeping:** Once we're connected to your systems, your financial data flows automatically. No more manual exports, no more reconciliation headaches. Your P&L and balance sheet are always current. Your accountant spends less time on data entry and more time on advice — which typically means lower accounting bills.

**Patient Financing:** We'll set you up with third-party financing options (CareCredit, Sunbit, or similar) that make it easy for patients to say yes to larger treatment plans. Practices that offer financing consistently see 20-40% higher case acceptance on treatment plans over $500.

Taken together, we estimate **$41,000–$101,000 in annual benefit** to the practice once the platform is fully connected. The details are in the Partnership Outline.

**What I Need From You to Get Started**

I've put together a streamlined information request — it's attached. Rather than asking for logins and passwords, the cleanest approach is simple authorization forms: you sign one page per system, and we handle the connectivity on our end. That way you're not managing any of the technical setup.

The key items:
- Which version of Dentrix you're on (cloud/Ascend vs. server-based)
- Last 3 months of merchant processing statements (so we can review your rates)
- Last 3 months of bank statements (to load your financial baseline into the system)
- P&L for Jan/Feb 2026 and Balance Sheet as of 12/31/25 (quick QuickBooks export)
- List of insurance payers you're credentialed with + copies of participation agreements
- Employee census or payroll access (for dashboard reporting)

None of this is urgent — send what you have and we'll work through the rest together. I understand some of this feels like a lot to share, which is exactly why I structured it around authorizations rather than raw credentials — you're giving us access to do a job, not handing over the keys.

**Attached Documents**

1. **Partnership Outline** — Full structure of the deal, your role, estimated practice benefits, capital allocation, timeline
2. **Practice Information Request** — Streamlined request with authorization-based access for each system
3. **Website & Platform Status** — Full rundown of everything that's been built and what's ready to go live

---

**Next Steps**

1. Let me know if the $20K investment and the structure makes sense for you
2. Send back whatever you can from the information request — even partial gets us moving
3. I'll get the operating agreement drafted and over to you
4. We'll schedule a call to walk through anything you want to review in detail

Alex, I genuinely believe this is a great opportunity — and more importantly, I think you're the right partner for this. Your credentials, your reputation in Las Vegas, and the practice you've built give Dental Engine instant credibility in the market. That's worth a lot, and I want to make sure we structure this in a way that's genuinely valuable to you and the practice, not just on paper.

Let me know your thoughts. Happy to jump on a call anytime.
