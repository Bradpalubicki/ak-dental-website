## Why This Matters for You

The information below helps us do three things that directly benefit your practice:

1. **Save you money** — We'll benchmark your merchant processing rates against current market rates. Most practices are overpaying 0.5–1.5% per transaction. On a practice doing $50K/month in card volume, that's $3,000–$9,000 per year left on the table.

2. **Reduce accounting time and cost** — By connecting your systems directly to the platform, we eliminate manual data entry, reduce bookkeeping hours, and give you accurate real-time financials without waiting on your accountant.

3. **Accelerate collections** — The single biggest opportunity for most dental practices is uncollected insurance revenue. We'll identify the gap and set up electronic billing to close it — automatically.

Everything you share is confidential, protected under our partnership agreement, and used solely to configure the platform for your practice. You share it once — the system does the work from there.

## Section 1: System Access (The Ideal Path)

Rather than collecting individual usernames and passwords, the cleanest approach is a simple **authorization grant** — you give us read access to each system, we pull what we need, and the platform stays connected going forward. Here's what that looks like for each system:

### Practice Management (Dentrix)
To connect Dental Engine to Dentrix, we need:
- [ ] Which version: **Dentrix Ascend (cloud/browser-based)** or **server-based Dentrix (G6, G7)?**
- [ ] Your Henry Schein/Dentrix support plan status (active support plan required for API access)
- [ ] Sign a one-page **third-party data access authorization** that we prepare — allows us to connect without you managing any technical setup

*That's it. We handle the rest with Henry Schein on your behalf.*

### Merchant Processing
To review your rates and connect payment processing:
- [ ] Processor name (e.g., Heartland, Clover, Worldpay, TransFirst, Square)
- [ ] **Last 3 months of merchant processing statements** (PDF from your processor portal or paper statements)
- [ ] Sign a **third-party authorization form** for your processor — allows us to pull rate data and optionally negotiate on your behalf

*We will review your effective rate, interchange fees, and any junk fees. If we find savings, we'll bring options to you. No obligation to switch.*

### Payroll
To integrate payroll reporting into the platform:
- [ ] Payroll provider name (e.g., Gusto, ADP, Paychex, QuickBooks Payroll)
- [ ] **Employee census** — a simple list of: employee name, title, full-time/part-time, hire date, hourly or salary. (Your payroll provider can export this in minutes.)
- [ ] OR: Grant us read-only access to your payroll platform (most providers support this with an "accountant access" or "advisor" login)

*Payroll integration automates labor cost reporting inside your dashboard — no more manual pulls.*

### Bank Account(s)
To establish a financial baseline and enable reconciliation:
- [ ] **Last 3 months of bank statements** for the primary practice operating account (PDF)
- [ ] OR: Connect via read-only bank feed (Plaid or similar — takes 2 minutes, read-only, no transaction access)

*This lets us load historical data so your dashboard shows real numbers from day one, not just data going forward. It also dramatically reduces your bookkeeper's reconciliation time.*

---

## Section 2: Financial Statements

To properly configure the accounting module and establish your financial baseline:

- [ ] **Profit & Loss Statement** — January and February 2026
- [ ] **Balance Sheet** — as of December 31, 2025
- [ ] **General Ledger account listing** (chart of accounts) — a list of your account names/numbers from QuickBooks or your accounting software

*These take about 5 minutes to export from QuickBooks. They allow us to map your existing accounts directly into the platform so reporting is consistent with what you already use — and your accountant's life gets easier, not harder.*

## Section 3: Insurance Billing Setup

AK Ultimate Dental does not currently use an electronic billing clearinghouse — all claims are submitted manually or through Dentrix directly. This is one of the highest-impact areas we can improve.

**What we will set up for you:**
- Electronic claim submission to all major dental payers
- Automated ERA (Electronic Remittance Advice) posting — payments auto-post to patient accounts
- Claim status tracking and denial management alerts
- Estimated setup time: 2-4 weeks after we receive your insurance contracts

**What we need:**
- [ ] Copies of your current insurance participation agreements (fee schedules) for each payer you're in-network with
- [ ] List of payers you're currently credentialed with (Delta Dental, Cigna, Aetna, MetLife, United, etc.)
- [ ] Current billing coordinator contact (if you have one) or confirmation that billing is handled in-house

**What this is worth to your practice:**

| Area | Estimated Impact |
|------|-----------------|
| Faster claim turnaround | From 30-45 days to 7-14 days average |
| Reduction in denied/missed claims | 15-30% improvement typical |
| Staff time saved on billing | 5-10 hours/week |
| Annual collections increase | $15,000–$40,000 for an average solo practice |

The electronic billing service itself has a monthly cost — we estimate **$X–$X/month** depending on claim volume — and that will be AK Dental's cost, not ours. We will integrate with it, configure it, and manage the setup entirely. You simply approve and we execute.

*Note: This is one of the fastest ROI items in the entire platform. Most practices recoup the monthly cost within the first 30-60 days through improved collections alone.*

## Section 4: Third-Party Financing

Offering patient financing increases case acceptance and average transaction size. We will set up integrations with one or more financing partners:

- [ ] Do you currently offer any patient financing? (e.g., CareCredit, LendingClub, Proceed Finance, Sunbit)
- [ ] If yes: provider name and account contact
- [ ] If no: we will recommend and set up the best option for your patient mix

*Third-party financing typically increases case acceptance on treatment plans over $500 by 20-40%. It costs the practice a discount rate (typically 3-8%) but converts cases that would otherwise not close.*

---

## Section 5: Practice Identifiers

Needed for billing enrollment and insurance credentialing setup (one-time):

- [ ] **Practice NPI** (Type 2 — Organization)
- [ ] **Provider NPI** — Alex Chireau DDS individual NPI
- [ ] **Tax ID / EIN** for the practice entity
- [ ] **Practice legal name** as it appears on insurance contracts
- [ ] State dental license number
